oconperf

OCaml connection performance test application

This is an application divided into a server and client part.

This is an intelligent performance test application displaying
on the client part performance statistics (latency, bandwidth).

The idea is to intellegilently measure both latency and bandwidth to
unsure good estimation of connections from satelites to ultra-high Gb
connections.
